# HW11 - noteTaking App
  
  ## Description
Alright onto something a bit more complicated, we are tasked with building an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes using Express.js back-end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. Given a built out front-end our job is to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
